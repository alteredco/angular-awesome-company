<h2>Good Morning City!</h2>
<p>Everything is better when we stick together.
    Side by side,
    you and I are
    gonna win forever.
    Let's party forever.
    We're the same, I'm like you, you're like me.
    We are working in harmony.</p>
    <p>
        Blue skies, bouncy springs.
We just named two awesome thing.
A Nobel prize, a piece of string.
You know what's awesome? Everything!
Dogs with fleas, allergies, a book of Greek antiquities...
Brand new pants, a very old vest, awesome items are the best...
Trees, frogs, clogs, they're awesome!
Rocks, clocks, and socks, they're awesome!
Figs, and jigs, and twigs, that's awesome!
Everything you see or think or say is awesome!
